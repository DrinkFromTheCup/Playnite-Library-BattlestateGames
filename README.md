### Escape from Tarkov Stand-alone launcher library integration for Playnite

Robust integration of Battlestate Games Launcher, complete with its only Escape from Tarkov game.

As of v0.0 (current release), the extension can:
- (planned) add EfT into your library,
- (planned) interact with BSG launcher (detect installed, launch, uninstall).

Do note that it's implied that of you DID got the launcher - you DO own the game.

(so if you DID got this extension - you DID jumped through all ownership-related hoops already, so no need in requesting auth from you, O, Player)

### Caveat Emptor

Extension's codebase is, essentially, a big bowl of spaghetti which just works.

Good enough for code made by person which is incompatible with programming on genetic level.

Exercise discretion prior to installing.
