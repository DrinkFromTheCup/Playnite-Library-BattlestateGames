### Escape from Tarkov Stand-alone launcher library integration for Playnite

Robust integration of Battlestate Games Launcher, complete with its one and only only Escape from Tarkov game.

As of v0.1 (current release), the extension can:
- add Escape from Tarkov into your library,
- interact with BSG launcher (detect installed, launch, uninstall).

Do note that it's implied that of you DID got the launcher - you DO own the game.

(so if you DID got this extension - you DID jumped through all ownership-related hoops at BSG site already, so no need in requesting auth from you, O, Player)

### Caveat Emptor

Interactions with Playnite plugins which might trigger false alarms from BSG anticheat are UNTESTED.

Exercise discretion prior to installing.
